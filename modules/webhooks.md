Webhooks are here to make temporary messages with custom names and avatars. They meant to be not recognizable. Indeed, a webhook doesn't have any TAG neither ID to separate them from others webhooks. Also, this is the only way to provide messages with multiple embeds at the same time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Webhooks **do not support** components! (neither interactions)
{% endhint %}

### Creating the webhook

In order to create a new webhook, simply navigate inside your wanted channel's settings. Go into the `Integrations` **** panel, then `Webhooks`:

![a channel's settings panel](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

Click on the `New Webhook` button, and just copy the webhook URL. The name and avatar that are shown here will be editable later:

### Registering the client

Once you have your webhook URL, you will have to register the client through DiSky, preferably in an `on script load` event using the following syntax:

```
on script load: # 'on load' will execute the code on each script reload.
    register webhook named "<name>" with url "<your webhook url here>"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The `<name>`part **does not** represent the webhook's configured name.

It's just a placeholder to reference the loaded client later in the code!

### Creating & Sending a custom message

As said in the introduction part of this page, webhooks will have custom messages to send. In addition of normal message data (such as text content, embeds, and/or files), you will have to define a specific **name** and **avatar URL** for the current message.

Here's a simple example with embeds, files, and everything the module can handle currently:

```applescript
command webhooks: # Any events are accepted of course
    trigger:
       # Even if a webhook have a pre-defined avatar and name, we can change that at every message.
        make a new webhook message:
 
            set webhook name of builder to "Test" # The new name. It DOES NOT affect the defined name.
            # Here's the avatar and the text content, both optional.
            set webhook avatar of builder to "https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/4/Coronavirus-PNG-Image.png"
            set webhook content of builder to "This is a test message"
            
            # Let's make an embed using DiSky's syntax:
            make embed:
                set title of embed to "Hey"
                set embed color of embed to orange
               
            # Then we just set the current embeds to the embed we just made.
            set webhook embeds of builder to last embed
            
            # Finally, we can make the client send the message we just made.
            # Because of Discord's limitations, we can only get back the message's ID.
            make client "<name>" send builder and store it in {_msgId}
            
            # OPTIONAL: Use the 'retrieve message' effect from DiSky in order to get an actual Message.
            send "Message id: %{_msgId}%" to console
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Webhooks can send **multiple embeds** within the same message!
{% endhint %}
