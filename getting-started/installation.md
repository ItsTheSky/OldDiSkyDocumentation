# 1⃣ Installation

You'll see here how to **install** DiSky correctly.

### 1. Server Requirements

DiSky is pretty flexible on server requirements, however some needed points must be completed:

* While **Skript** work, DiSky will work.
* DiSky **require** Skript v**2.6+**!
* ... and that's all!...

While Skript is running good, and using 2.6+ version, DiSky should run without any problem!

We however recommend [**the official fork**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest) of Skript (maintained by _SkriptLang_).

### 2. Installation

Once Skript & DiSky are downloaded, move them in the `plugins/` folder and **restart** your server.

> :warning: **Reloading** your server is the worst thing to do! No support will be provided if you do so.

Wait a little for Skript & DiSky to load, then go into `plugins/Skript/scripts/`, create a new file ending by `.sk` and write your first script!

### Add-ons Compatibility

DiSky is a pretty big add-on, that's add a lot of different features.

Some **syntax** can be in conflicts with others from Add-ons.

> :white\_check\_mark: DiSky try to avoid any conflict **with Skript**, but cannot always think about every other add-ons!

### Configuration

DiSky **don't need** to be configurable, everything is done through Skript code.

You can still request configuration keys for X or Y features on our **Discord** or in the [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky)
